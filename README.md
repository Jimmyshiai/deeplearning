# Deep learning
This git is mainly used to log the whole learning process of machine learning, especially on deeping learning, which aims at achieving the supporting requests being answered automatically.

This git will include the following:
1. Text clustering ( Supervised and unsupvised algorithms).
2. Auto-response on the supporting requests (Chatbot could be one of options)
3. Visualize the deep learning ( Understand how deep learning works, then try to utilize transfer learning).

#### Proposed learning steps

In this section, the following learning steps with the learning materials would be proposed to get the deep learning understood step-by-step.

1. Understanding the basic concepts and termns of deep learning:

2. Understanding the math functions behind deep learning by the example of vallina RNN:

## Aplogize for this git is still in progress, and the official version may come out by the Jan 2019.
