# Deep learning
This git is mainly used to log the whole learning process of machine learning, especially on deeping learning, which aims at achieving the supporting requests being answered automatically.

This git will include the following:
1. Text clustering ( Supervised and unsupvised algorithms).
2. Auto-response on the supporting requests (Chatbot could be one of options)
3. Visualize the deep learning ( Understand how deep learning works, then try to utilize transfer learning).
