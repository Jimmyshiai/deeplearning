But, generally, categorical_crossentropy is better for dealing with probabilities—it measures the \"distance\" between probability distributions, or in our case, between the ground-truth distribution and the predictions.\n",

    "This isn't the case for the validation loss and accuracy—they seem to peak after about twenty epochs. This is an example of overfitting: the model performs better on the training data than it does on data it has never seen before. After this point, the model over-optimizes and learns representations specific to the training data that do not generalize to test data.\n",
    "For this particular case, we could prevent overfitting by simply stopping the training after twenty or so epochs. Later, you'll see how to do this automatically with a callback."
